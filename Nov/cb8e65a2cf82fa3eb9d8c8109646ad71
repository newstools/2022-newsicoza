The DA, on Friday, laid criminal charges against the Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure, Patricia de Lille, and her department’s acting Director General, Dr Alec Moremi at the Odendaalsrus police station. The minister acknowledged in a parliamentary reply that the failure of her department to timeously fix a sewerage pump at the Odendaalsrus Correctional Centre led to a criminal offence being committed in terms of section 151 of the National Water Act. Not only did it cause the sewage to on occasion flow back into the facility and led to human rights violations, but it also caused lasting environmental damage to surrounding areas and polluted surrounding freshwater streams. The Minister and DG are further guilty in that: The DA will continue to monitor this case. The Minister and her department should urgently ensure that the mess created is cleaned up. This is their job. However, such action cannot indemnify them from the fact that a criminal offence was committed.
