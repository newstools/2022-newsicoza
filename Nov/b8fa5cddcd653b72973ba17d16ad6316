A 46-year-old Israeli gang leader attached to a criminal organisation in Israel called the ‘Abergil Organisation’ has been arrested along with seven others at a house in Bryanston. The Abergil crime family is a crime organisation based in Israel, but located around the world. It was headed by Ya’akov Abergil until his death in 2002, and then run by Itzhak Abergil, among others. The multi-disciplinary team responsible for the eventual arrest was led by Interpol South Africa, and included Organised Crime, Detectives, Crime Intelligence and the Special Task Force (STF). The Israeli gang leader has been on Interpol’s Red Notice since 2015. He is a wanted suspect in Israel for conspiracy to commit murder and attempted murder. The crime family is also known for drug trafficking, money laundering, embezzlement and extortion. According to the South African Police Service (SAPS), in 2003 and 2004, this suspect allegedly placed an explosive bomb underneath a vehicle of a man in Israel in two separate incidents. As a result of the first explosion, five people sustained serious injuries but all miraculously survived. In the second incident, the suspect attempted to do the same with the same victim, where he placed a bomb on top of a vehicle. In this incident, three people also sustained serious injuries. The SAPS statement read: “During an early morning take down operation, the team pounced on an identified address in Bryanston and found the suspect and seven others, 12 firearms including 5 x assault rifles and 7 x pistols , 40 000 US dollars, 3 suspected stolen motorcycles were siezed”.
