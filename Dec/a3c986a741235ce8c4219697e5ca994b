Tomorrow, 5 December 2022, the DA will be laying charges of fraud and perjury against political office bearers of the Knysna Municipality. This follows the DA’s victory for democracy against cadre deployment and corruption in the Western Cape High Court last week. Judge Henny was scathing in his remarks on how an attempt was made to “commit fraud on the court” by deponents who lied in their affidavits submitted to the court. The DA will not stand by while the ANC/Patriotic Alliance/PBI/EFF Coalition of Corruption attempts to capture our town and steal hardworking ratepayer’s money to fund jobs for their political cronies.
