The DA welcomes the SANParks board’s approval of polygraph testing for employees in an effort to combat the rampant ongoing poaching of South Africa’s endangered wildlife. The approval was confirmed in response to a DA question to Minister Barabara Creecy and after ongoing pressure from DA MPs. The Minister has now committed to fully implement the testing by the end of 2023 and the DA will be keeping a keen eye on progress to ensure that this happens. The DA has been one of the strongest advocates for the use of polygraph testing as a means to hold SANParks employees to account. Our members in the National Assembly have raised the matter on numerous prior occasions through written questions and portfolio oversight. Plans to implement polygraph testing have unfortunately been stalled for many years, during which time thousands of endangered animals, in particular our rhinos have been poached. The move will sadly come too late for the many rangers who have lost their lives to poachers and so many animals that have been the victims of collaboration between corrupt staff members in SANParks and the criminal underworld. The Minister must do all she can to compel the Minister of Police to work with Interpol to tackle these criminal networks, both in South Africa and abroad.
