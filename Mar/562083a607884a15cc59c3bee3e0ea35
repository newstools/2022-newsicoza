The South African Zionist Federation (SAZF) applauds all participants in the inaugural Negev Summit, in Southern Israel, that took place on 27 and 28 March 2022, between the foreign ministers of Israel, Morocco, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt, and the United States. Such a summit, which is illustrative of a new era of Middle Eastern collaboration and peace, would have been unthinkable even a few years ago. The Abraham Accords have paved the way for cooperation. Former hostile Arab nations and Israel, now stand together to confront challenges in their shared region. This summit is of historical importance and is to be welcomed by Jews and Arabs in all nations and indeed all global citizens. The Negev Summit is progressing the path of friendliness and cooperation between Israel and her Arabs neighbours, and supporters globally, taking place today. On the African Continent, this is evidenced by the granting of observer status to Israel at the African Union in 2021. We call on our government to heed the regional and global trends and be part of finding a path towards peace and reconciliation in the region.
