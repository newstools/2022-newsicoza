South African Friends of Israel (SAFI) and the Women’s International Zionist Organisation (WIZO) joined forces on Nelson Mandela Day, and provided ten physically challenged children and youth cutting-edge technology wheelchairs from Israeli company Wheelchairs of Hope, giving them the gift of mobility and changing their lives and futures. The event took place at Credo Mutwa Village, Jabavu, Soweto, and Takalani Home for the Mentally Handicapped, near Baragwanath Hospital, Soweto. Credo Mutwa was a teacher of the philosophy of Ubuntu – meaning: believing the common bonds within a group are paramount and are more important than any individual arguments and divisions within it. Ubuntu mirrors the Jewish philosophy of Tikkun Olam (repairing the world) on which WIZO bases its philanthropic work. SAFI’s general manager Pamela Ngubane, and spokesperson Bafana Modise, attended the event with Andrea Wainer from WIZO, and Karabo Ramathe, a SAFI volunteer. Pamela Ngubane spoke of the importance of collaboration, “The collaboration between SAFI and WIZO is groundbreaking as SAFI can give WIZO and other Jewish and Israeli organisations access to communities where the resources and skills of these organisations can be utilised.” This event highlighted the benefits South Africa’s relationship with Israel can bring to South African communities. Israeli technology and expertise, including water, solar, farming and medical technologies and innovations, have been used in various countries in Africa for the betterment of communities.
