Following the removal of Section 79 Oversight Committee Chairpersons at Thursday’s meeting of the Johannesburg Council, the House, presided over by the Speaker, Cllr Colleen Makhubele, elected Cllr Lloyd Philips of GOOD Party as the Chairperson of Chairpersons this afternoon, thus further entrenching the corrupt ANC’s programme of capturing and collapsing the City. ActionSA elected to go into this Council meeting on their own, therefore opening the doors wider for the corrupt ANC cabal to elect their candidates. As the DA, IFP, Freedom Front Plus (FF+), ACDP and UIM, we had elected to go into this meeting as a bloc, having consulted with ActionSA, with the intention of halting the ANC from getting their members elected to hold key legislature oversight structures. With the ANC currently fully at the helm of the Executive and Legislature, we find it difficult to see a scenario where corruption does not become the order of business in Joburg. The fight for Joburg, its residents, and the Rule of Law is being waged on all fronts, as we await the imminent judgment by the High Court declaring the removal of the Executive Mayor on 30 September 2022 to be unconstitutional, invalid, and illegal, as well as the decisions taken subsequent to that. This fight is not for positions or salaries but rather to ensure that the disastrous and anti-service delivery programme of the ANC does not once again find ground in Joburg. As the DA, we will continue this fight until all avenues have been exhausted; all for the sake of residents and service delivery. In truth, this is not the DA’s fight but the residents’ fight.
